These 3 driver packages are needed: 

OpenNI-Bin-Dev-Linux-x64-v1.5.7.10 

NITE-Bin-Dev-Linux-x64-v1.5.2.23 

Sensor-Bin-Linux-x64-v5.1.2.1 

 

So, we follow these steps: 

 

Xxxxxx  Getting Drivers  xxxxxxx 

 

>> git clone https://github.com/ZXWBOT/kinect_driver.git 

 

Now Install dependencies I.e 

 

>> sudo apt-get install g++ python libusb-1.0-0-dev freeglut3-dev openjdk-8-jdk doxygen graphviz mono-complete  

 

Now the drivers are loaded 

 

Xxxxxxx Installation Instructions xxxxxxx 

 

Copy the whole "kinect_driver" repository that we cloned above from git to /home directory   

 

>> cd /home/venkatesh/kinect_driver/OpenNI-Bin-Dev-Linux-x64-v1.5.7.10 

 

>> sudo ./install.sh 

 

Installing OpemNI 

.. 

. 

. 

***Done*** 

 

>> cd /home/venkatesh/kinect_driver/NITE-Bin-Dev-Linux-x64-v1.5.2.23 

 

>> sudo ./install.sh 

 

Installing NITE 

. 

. 

. 

*** Done *** 

 

>> cd /home/venkatesh/kinect_driver/Sensor-Bin-Linux-x64-v5.1.2.1 

 

>> sudo ./install.sh 

 

Installing PrimeSense Sensor 

. 

. 

. 

*** Done *** 

 

>> cd home/venkatesh/OpenNI-Bin-Dev-Linux-x64-v1.5.7.10/Samples/Bin/x64-Release 

 

>> ./NiViewer 

 

You will see 

 

One or more of the following nodes could not be enumerated: 

  

Device: PrimeSense/SensorV2/5.1.6.6: The device is not connected! 

Device: PrimeSense/SensorV2/5.1.0.41: The device is not connected! 

Device: PrimeSense/SensorV2/5.1.6.6: The device is not connected! 

Device: PrimeSense/SensorV2/5.1.0.41: The device is not connected! 

  

Press any key to continue . . . 

 

Do not worry. Open new terminal  

 

Xxxxxxxxxxxxx Changing permissions xxxxxxxxxxx 

  

>> cd 

 

You are now in /home/venkatesh 

 

>> sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/XnSensorServer 

 

Now connect the Kinect. Make sure that the power and usb are connected 
Note that only usb 3.0 will work. (Both usbs are 3.0 in my xps 13) 

 

>> cd home/venkatesh/OpenNI-Bin-Dev-Linux-x64-v1.5.7.10/Samples/Bin/x64-Release 

 

>> ./NiViewer  

 

You will see two windows 

1) The kinect acting as camera 

2) A depth image section, but it is only yellow. Depth is still not detected well 

 

Xxxxxxxxx Install libfreenect xxxxxxxxxxxxxx 

 

>> git clone https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect.git   

>> cd libfreenect 
  

>> mkdir build 
 

>> cd build 
 

>> cmake -L .. 
  

>> make 
 

>> sudo make install 

 

Now  

>>  cd home/libfreenect/build/bin 

>> sudo ldconfig â€“v 

 

Important: To run kinect  

>> cd /home/venkatesh/kinect_driver/libfreenect/build/bin 

 

Then type >> sudo freenect-glview 

 

You will now see two windows 

1) Kinect acting as camera 

2) Kinect with depth sensor switched on 

You can observe that the green light on kinect 360 turns red

After that in cd /home/venkatesh/ do: 

>> sudo apt install python-freenect
